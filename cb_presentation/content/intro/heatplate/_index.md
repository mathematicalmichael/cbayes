### Consider the following experiment:

{{< figure src="/intro/heatplate/images/heatplate_omega.png" width="400px">}}

We heat the center of a metallic plate $\Omega$.

$\Omega$ is manufactured by welding two smaller plates.

Each plate has different (uncertain) thermal conductivities, denoted $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$. 

We expect the temperature profile to differ on each half.
