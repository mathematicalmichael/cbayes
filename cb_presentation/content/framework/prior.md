# A novel measure-theoretic framework
{{<tex display="\pi^{\dagger}_\Lambda(\lambda) := \pi_\Lambda(\lambda)\frac{\pi_{\mathcal{D}}(Q(\lambda))}{\pi^{Q}_{\mathcal{D}}(Q(\lambda))} ">}}

<br>

We use Bayes' Rule _along_ contours. 

The prior {{<tex "\pi_\Lambda(\lambda)">}} plays a role **only** in these directions.

It differentiates among sets that belong to the same contour $\sigma$-algebra.
