# A novel measure-theoretic framework

{{<tex display="\pi^{\dagger}_\Lambda(\lambda) := \pi_\Lambda(\lambda)\frac{\pi_{\mathcal{D}}(Q(\lambda))}{\pi^{Q}_{\mathcal{D}}(Q(\lambda))} ">}}


_Across_ contours, we invert {{<tex display="\pi_{\mathcal{D}}(Q(\lambda)).">}}

The term {{<tex "\pi^{Q}_{\mathcal{D}}(Q(\lambda))">}} is called the **push-forward** measure of the prior. 

Characterizing this measure is unique to our approach for solving stochastic inverse problems.
