### We could instead define a misfit function as our QoI instead.

This effectively turns our QoI into a **scalar-valued** map.
{{<tex "\newcommand{\lam}{(\lambda)}">}}
{{<tex "\newcommand{\qoi}{Q\lam}">}}
{{<tex display="\qoi = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{i=1}^M \left(\frac{O_i\lam-d_i}{\sigma_i}\right)^2">}}

This represents our average deviation from the data.

### What are the differences?
